## Guess The Number project

The project has two main modes (both console):

1. **guess** function creates a random number (between 1 and the parameter passed) and lets the user guess it.
  * To play the game just input the numbers and look at the tips.

2. **computer_guess** function tries to guess the number (between 1 and the parameter passed) that user is thinking of.
  * To play the game you need to answer if the computer's guess is too low (l), too high (h) or correct (c)

 The project was created after [Kylie Ying's course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ycubed )
